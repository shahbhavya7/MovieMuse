# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**! This project leverages the **TMDB database** to offer personalized movie recommendations using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Content-Based Filtering approach** powered by **Cosine Similarity**. The system is deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for an intuitive and interactive experience.
